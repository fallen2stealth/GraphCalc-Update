GRAPHCALC'S FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
======================================

Q: I just checked out the source, why won't it compile?
A: Excellent question.  You would think it should.  The program was
   originally developed under Windows98.  It compiles there just fine.
   The problem comes when trying to compile under W2K/ME/XP.  We are
   not very interested in maintaining the windows port anymore, but if
   you'd like to help diagnose the problem, feel free.

Q: Where is the linux version?
A: Forthcoming.  Frankly, we have no Linux development experience, but
   we figure that the friendly people at SourceForge might lend us a
   hand.  If you have any suggestions for where to start, what libraries
   to use, or just want to flame us, please drop a note to
   authors@graphcalc.com

Q: Why didn't you <X>?  You should have <Y>.
A: We're new to this.  Please be kind.  Please feel free to make
   constructive comments.

Q: Your CVS Repository is all messed up.
A: That's not a question.  But yes, it is.  I'm sorry, I refer you to
   our previous answer.

Q: But I want a linux version now!
A: Again, questions would be nicer.  If you're desperate, you should
   check out wine.  It executes the expression and 2d graphings
   capabilities very well.  The 3D OpenGL part is somewhere between
   fluky and non-functional under wine.  Good luck.
