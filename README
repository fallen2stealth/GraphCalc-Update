Welcome to GraphCalc
====================

* DESCRIPTION

GraphCalc is a very gui graphing calculator. It has been called a good
replacement for a TI-85. It is a must for any high school math student.
It combines the simplicity of a four function figurer with the power of
2D and 3D graphing.


* REQUIREMENTS

The windows version of GraphCalc requires the OpenGL libraries which
have been included with Windows since version 95b.  If your version of
Windows is missing OpenGL32.DLL, go to http://www.opengl.org/ to
download a copy.

When the linux version is ready for distribution, requirements will be
listed here.
